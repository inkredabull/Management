## Leadership Style
I love what I've heard referred to as a Japanese saying: “If your only tool is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.” Correspondingly, I have several different leadership styles I apply depending on the situation and the needs of the individual/team.

### As a Servant Leader
It's important to think about one’s own value-add to any team. These days, I add the most value as someone who force-multiplies, someone who runs point on understanding challenges to be overcome - perhaps prototyping a solution - but ultimately empowering a small team to take ownership, execute, and deliver.

My track record shows that I'm not afraid to still get into the weeds to make contributions while scaling out teams and products.

### As a Coaching Leader
I pride myself on being a good coach. I employ the Socratic method as appropriate. I’ve learned that leadership requires repeating messages as often as necessary to make sure they stick. 

I love the saying that “the job is preparation for the job” and I appreciate that we are all on a journey, bringing a certain Learn-to-Leverage Ratio to what we do as work. Related, when evaluating a team member’s performance, I keep in mind the paradigm of “Skill-vs-Will” I learned back in 2021 to help me understand if the role and responsibilities are a fit.

I seek to “praise in public and criticize in private.” 

Within reason given other demands on my time and abilities, I want to help people level up in their careers. I never envisioned myself an advocate for Kaizen in quite the way I've become, but I understand the principles and philosophy in a radically different way than I did a decade ago.

### As a Directive Leader
Sometimes, to deliver results, things just need to get done. Sometimes it takes a strong personality to tell others to do those things; I do that when the moment calls for it. 

### As a Visionary Leader
A favorite quote attributed to Antoine de Saint-Exupéry - paraphrased - is: “If you want to build a ship, don’t drum up people to gather wood, divide the work, and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea. To swing for the fences, to go for the Big Hairy Audacious Goals, it takes that sort of ability - the recognition of the importance of establishing and communicating a Northstar to work towards.

## First Principles

Over the years, I’ve adopted a few mantras you’re likely to hear me repeat. 

### Crawl. Walk. Run.
I got this from a friend / teammate years ago and have found no better abstraction to help teams from getting ahead of themselves.

### Don't Boil the Ocean.
This is the only other comparable metaphor, particularly around trying to do all the things right now. This is a perfect lead-in to …

### Form Follows Function.
I love delivering a polished user experience but even more important to me is the value-added benefit to the user of the functionality delivered.

### If Everything’s a Priority, Nothing is a Priority. 
I'm a big fan of the Big Rocks paradigm I learned about from Stephen Covey. A corollary to this is: “If you're trying to be all things to all people, you will fail.”

### Perfect is the Enemy of Good.
Don't get me wrong; I want to ship a great user experience. Also, the game of software is a constant trade-off of art against science. Delivering quality code in production is an intricate dance. I embrace a bias for action and encourage my teams to do the same while seeking to avoid bike-shedding.

### See Something, Say Something.
When requirements or design changes occur, document those updates. Effective remote work hinges on the efficient organization of written information. Recording meetings and translating them into written documentation enables flexible productivity. Contribute to the requirements-definition process, and self-serve to answer questions while openly communicating when assumptions need confirmation. Providing context and sharing links can greatly improve clarity and reduce manual processes.

### We Get to ‘Done.’
Each team’s Definition of ‘Done’ varies but I've found it the single most critical component of execution.

Here’s a baseline to begin from:

* Code must operate per requirements/workflows defined in the user story.
* Unit tests have been added. 
* The PR build passes (incl. linting, CI/CD, formatting, etc.)
* Related documentation is added/updated (inline, READMEs, Wiki, etc..)
* Employ the scout rule: “Be sure to leave it better than you found it.”

### No Surprises.
NO ONE likes surprises, ever. When in doubt, call it out. 

## Expectations of Myself

### Overall
What I need to be successful are transparency, accountability, and clear and respectful communications. I've been in environments where critical aspects of business performance were obfuscated away. The smoke-and-mirrors culture prevents me from doing my best work. 

If you say you're going to do something by a certain date and time, do it. If you can't, be sure to let me know. By the way, feel free to hold me to the same standard. 

I know that communication is a two-way street. Sometimes I need to keep my side cleaner. I can't do what I need to do if you're not giving me what I need to know.

I generally regard myself as a technologist avoiding the 'hammer sees a nail' mindset, incl. around Quality.

### Responsibilities

In a nutshell, here’s what I see being my responsibilities:

* Drive qualitative/quantitative improvements of people, processes, and structures/systems.
* Effectively balance trade-offs, competing priorities, and complexity in the roadmap against team capabilities and timelines.
* Build effective relationships with key stakeholders across the company.
* Exhibit a bias for action, particularly while unblocking teams to ship quality, incremental releases.
* Raise the bar cross-functionally through mentorship, continuous-learning opportunities, and performance review and improvement.
 
### Objectives

Simplified, that boils down to a few high-level objectives:

* Build for scale
* Improve performance
* Enhance quality
* Hire/retain top talent

## Expectations of Team

### Overall

On multiple occasions, I have quickly engendered trust with newly-inherited teams thanks to my engineering background, technical abilities, comprehension of architecture, and problem-solving skills. 

I value grit, resilience, attention-to-detail, accountability, process, & clear communications. 

I prize ego-free leadership and while looking to foster a culture of trust and respect with my reports around not only their professional performance but also system performance and architecture. 

### Meetings have agendas

Meetings need to 1) have and 2) follow agendas.  Sure, there can be space made for ad hoc discussions but I've far too often been in meetings that ran too long and wasted too much time  because there were lots of opinions and no focus. Agendas help provide focus. 

### Notes get taken

In the vein of accountability, it's important to document findings and/or decisions in meetings. 
I hate for any one person - including myself - to always need to play the role of Scribe so one tool I've utilizied is fireflies.ai to automatically transcribe/summarize meeting notes. 

### “I don’t know” is a fine answer.

My trust is easily undermined when a person employs the tactic of speaking confidently about a topic they don’t know about. 

It's okay for you not to know, but then say so and go find out.

I've been in the software game for 20 years now and played a number of roles. I’ve forgotten not quite as much as I’ve learned but a career in this industry has necessitated a level of grit and adaptation. Afford me the benefit of the doubt that I probably know a thing or two about the topic we’re discussing … and I'll reciprocate the same. 

### During Remote Meetings
* For best audio quality, use headphones; preferably with an embedded microphone
* Ensure you have enough bandwidth for a good connection
* Don't interrupt others
* Mute yourself when not speaking
* Clear your throat before coming off mute
* Limit background noise when possible

### My Quirks

####  I live by my calendar.
The work I do is a big part of my overall abundant life. I'm married and the father of two young children so I follow a fairly structured day in order to make that overall abundant life possible.

#### I’m process-oriented.
It’s just how I’m built and it’s (mostly) worked for me. An early influence for me was Stephen Covey's paradigm about 'Big Rocks.’ 

Although I have navigated chaotic and ambiguous work challenges and environments while demonstrating grit and resilience on numerous occasions, I tend to do best in structured situations.

#### Please don’t ask me for project updates
I'm only being slightly facetious about this. 

If I've done my job and put mechanisms and visibility in place, I should not be the bottleneck for an understanding of where projects stand. I’m big into ‘self-serve’ and am a proponent of teaching people to fish versus feeding them the fish.

#### I need to be celebrated.
I'm not saying this needs to be every single day in every conversation but a “nice job!” goes a long way. I’ve learned in previous environments where there was a scarcity of celebration and acknowledgment … that I'm human and I need to be appreciated too. When I wind up feeling taken for granted, that’s the beginning of the end.  

#### I’m good with spreadsheets.
Only in recent years have I perfected my skills. I wish somebody would have convinced me early in my career of the utility of the skillset.

#### I love to automate.
I don't automate just to automate. While I’m good with RegExes and shell scripting, I see automation as a means to an end, simply handling lower-level tasks so I can focus on higher-level value-add.

## Misc.
